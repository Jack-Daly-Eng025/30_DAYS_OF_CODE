# HELLO WORLD! This repository was initialized orginally with the idea of being my primary target for uploads and updates of my 30 DAY CODING challenge on GitHub.

## Obviously, I didn't focus on finishing these projects in the end, for good reason, they weren't substanstial enough to continue work on. 

## This repository was to hold work-in-progress projects over 30 days of coding. 

## I made this repository to track my progress over 30 days as a developer. 

## Since then however, I moved on to other projects and reprioritised. 

There are pinned on my main GitHub page under my personal README.md
[Jack's Profile](http://github.com/Jack-Daly-Eng025)

### Projects included  here were: 

* A Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This was mostly just me finishing a tutorial than creating something on my own.  I added my own twist on things, but I like to think I have progressed on from this early attempt, which was a early excerise in creating something 'impressive' that I could stick on my GitHub at a time when I'd be heavily neglecting my profile. I have moved on to other projects in Python and likely won't revisit this.

* A GitHub.io hosted website mainatined with HTML5, CSS and Javascript. - I'm honestly happy with how this turned out, but I know I could do better now after spending time to go back over the basics for HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. I'll attempt to redo my "portfolio" page during my 60 days of code challenge.
  
* A Simple App made with Tauri and Leptos Tech-Stack. I am still committed to mastering using Tauri as a developer, as I believe it will make my toolkit as a developer stronger and help me build more variety with my portfolio. Maybe I'll revisit this project.
  
* A project folder showing a imperfect donut made in Blender- This was from a tutorial I never finished but need to revisit, because I have sinced decided on pursuing game development and want to learn how to make my own assets as a game dev.
